# K-means-clustering
This project is based on a real problem a restaurant chain once had. Sticks Kabob wanted to open up a new restaurant. They need to figure out which location out of 4 to pick from. They also wanted to target a group of people based of their behaviors. This project is based on a survey data done by Sticks. R is used for this project.

Note that the model fitting is not included, due to lost files.
